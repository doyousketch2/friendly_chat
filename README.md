Wherever your Minetest dir is,  

if the `clientmods` dir doesn't exist, create it.  

Enter the dir.  If it's empty, create a new text file called `mods.conf`  

Add this line of code to that text file, and save:  

`load_mod_friendly_chat = true`  

---

unzip `friendly_chat` in your minetest/clientmods dir.  

GitHub often sends zip files as `friendly_chat-master.zip`  
so you'll want to rename the unzipped folder, if need be, to read `friendly_chat`  


enable client mods in advanced settings menu or in minetest.conf  
after loading Minetest, and in game, type **.list** or **.l** to see menu.
